# To add css in html:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/style.css">

# To test if style.css is working ?

    to test that it appears on the page

# Selectors

    element selectors - the tag names mentioned will select al the content mentioned in that tag name in that document eg:- p {}, body {}

    class selector - if you want to style only particular element we can give class names for the tags eg:- .img-background-color {}

    id selector - same as class selector. eg:- #form {}

# When to use selectors - specificity

    specificity - rewriting the properties
